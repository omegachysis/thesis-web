            <p>Here is a place to see ongoing questions or general ideas that have 
                not been formalized well enough to become tasks on their own yet; also 
                here is found questions that may not be sufficient for this thesis or 
                may be too difficult to answer yet.

                    Is it possible in a realistic timeframe to use these methods to evolve CA 
                    that maintain homeostasis in an environment of finite resources? 
                    Is it possible to even develop the concept of resource-gathering in a 
                    stochastic model?
                </h6>
            </div>
            <p>
                With the stochastic mass-preserving models tried so far,
                it is clear that there can be some sense of 'separation' that occupies a 
                finite volume, as expansion cannot go unlimited. However, it is not clear 
                what it might mean to think of the environment as having 'energy' or resources 
                that can be 'gathered' by an evolutionary CA in the model.

                    Asssuming Evo-CA with competitive resource-gathering behaviors 
                    can be generated, can we transition from genetic algorithms to 
                    selection based on those simulations alone?
                </h6>
            </div>
            <p>
                While it makes sense to use genetic algorithms or some other 
                evolutionary method on isolated simulations of each individual to initially
                form those individuals and analyze their complexity, it might make sense to 
                eventually examine how those individuals interact or even try to observe 
                emergence on the population level, not just on the invidual level. This 
                opens the potentiality of analyzing <strong>co-evolution</strong> on top 
                of basic self-organiziation, but it is not clear now how that might work 
                or what the ideal time to switch would be, or if that is even a feasible step.

                <h6>
                    Should we focus on evolving initial states, cell rules,
                    environmental factors, or all three in a hybrid model?
                </h6>
            </div>
            <p>
                We can either fix stochastic rules and environments and evolve the 
                starting state of the system to attempt to produce emergent behavior, do 
                the same but evolve rules instead, or we can fix the other two and evolve the 
                'environment', or the way the cell values are changed dynamically throughout 
                the simulation (e.g. we might inject random spikes in mass into the simulation 
                as it runs to simulation inputs of 'energy'). Maybe generating emergent behavior 
                the eventually mimics microbiological processes will be found the fastest 
                by taking on a hybrid model of all of these factors. However, there might be 
                some crossover between the fitness function and these adjustments in an 
                undesireable way (e.g. random injections of energy might be 
                indistinguishable from self-organization on some levels).

                    How complex does the model need to be to support features like 
                    self-replication evolving without fine-tuning?
                </h6>
            </div>
            <p>
                We already know that fairly simple transition rules on simple binary CAs 
                are enough to have Turing-completeness as well as self-replication
                (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton</a>), but no 
                substantial evidence has been produced of evolving cellular automata 
                with self-replication where the rules are not fine-tuned for 
                producing said features. If the rules are stochastic, how complex do 
                they have to be to produce self-replication and other life-like behavior?
                With completely local behavior, it is much harder to conclude the a minimal
                set of particles and/or physical laws is enough to simulate complex behavior.
                Real biochemical processes which do have a very limited 
                set of base elementary particles and physical laws guide very complex 
                formations but are governed by non-local forces and equations of motion 
                that cellular automata do not simulate. A natural hypothesis might then be 
                that the cells in a CA capable of life-like behavior are actually 
                analogous to fields and groups of cells are analogous to particles instead 
                of the usual model that cells in a CA are analogous to chemicals or even 
                subsystems of an organism. If this is the case, even the most rudimentary 
                life-like behavior might only evolve without fine-tuning under 
                limited sets of cells or rules when the grid is absurdly large.

                    What real-life structures would the cells in an evolving-CA be 
                    analogous to if life-like behavior is observed?
                    Particles? Chemicals? Proteins? Organelles? Organisms?
                    Maybe none of these?
